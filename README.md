# Chatie

This project is an example Django project created mostly using ChatGPT 3.5.
The project it self, views, javascript and HTML, were created using ChatGPT with copy and paste.
At some point I started to modify manually since it start to answer really slow.

## What's about:

The project is just one view that allow user to record an audio message (by holding the button), when release the audio is sent to OpenAI whisper API transcribed and sent to ChatGPT to return a JSON containing the requested fields: "first_name", "last_name", "age".

## Example:

In the example and text English and Spanish are used to test the API with these cases
